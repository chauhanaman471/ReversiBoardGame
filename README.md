Features
Flexible board size specified by the user.
Full implementation of Reversi game rules, including move validation and token flipping.
Clear text-based board visualization.
Tracks the game's end state and declares the winner.

Prerequisites
C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later).
A terminal or console to run the compiled program.
Setup and Compilation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>  
cd ReversiGame  
Compile the program using a C++ compiler. For example:

bash
Copy code
g++ -o reversi main.cpp ReversiBoard.cpp ReversiConsoleView.cpp  
Run the compiled executable:

bash
Copy code
./reversi  
Usage
Start the program and specify the board dimensions (e.g., 8x8 for a standard Reversi board).
Players take turns entering the position (x, y) and token (x for Player 1, o for Player 2).
To end the game early, enter -1 as the x-coordinate.
The game announces the winner when no valid moves remain, or the board is full.

Game Rules
Players alternate turns placing their tokens on the board.
A move is valid if it flanks one or more opponent tokens in any direction.
All flanked tokens are flipped to the current player's token.
The game ends when:
The board is full.
Neither player has valid moves.
The player with the most tokens on the board wins.
